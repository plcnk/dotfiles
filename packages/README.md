# Packages

These are the scripts which I use to install all my packages.

## Windows

Just add execution privileges (`chmod +x packages.sh`) and execute the script (`./packages.sh`).

## macOS

You first need to install Homebrew:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Then install the packages with `brew bundle --file Brewfile`.
